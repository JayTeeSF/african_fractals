saw a ted talk about fractals being part of many African societies,
and realized they were even part of the culture (every woman my mom's age would be treated like my mom,
every man my dad's age would be treated like my dad, etc). Yet the presenter seemed to suggest that these
indepth mathematical concepts were *just there* ...as if (before the books were stolen and burned) the folk
didn't have the ability to explain the significance of what they were doing, and why.

Moreover, he saw the concepts being put to practical use in fence building, village design, and more.

Anyway, all that got me excited about writing some code to generate fractals from a starting-image
(i.e. sort-of an automata / genetic-programmiing exercise)
